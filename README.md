SandboxMQ
=========

A sandbox which demonstrates a marriage between Aurora and ZeroMQ to bring the 
web framework totally off ASP.NET

**NOTE: This won't run out of the box. I'll explain and provide usage later, I 
want to get this online but do not have the time to give it a proper introduction 
yet. Note that this code is quite old and contains an old copy of Aurora 
(my MVC framework) and Miranda (my tiny wiki)**
